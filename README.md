## Overview

The purpose of this challenge was simply to practice foundational semantic HTML and scss skills because I've been doing a lot of meetings, accessibility audits and writing documentation recently. It's good to keep skills sharp! ;)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- See visible focus states for interactive elements when navigating by keyboard
- Understand and be able to navigate page content while using assistive technology
